# Contributing To Talent Pilot Frontend

This repository uses a protected-main workflow. Contributors must work from feature branches and open pull requests into `main`.

## Push Policy

- Contributors must not push automatically after generating or editing code.
- A push is allowed only when Mudasar Ahmad or the current user explicitly asks for it in the active session.
- When a push is requested, push only the contributor's own branch.
- Never push directly to `main`.
- Never push unrelated files, another contributor's work, local build outputs, secrets, or temporary files.
- AI-assisted contributors must summarize what will be pushed before pushing when the branch contains mixed or dirty work.

## Main Branch Protection

- Do not push directly to `main`.
- Only the code owner, Mudasar Ahmad, may make direct changes to `main`.
- All contributors, including AI-assisted contributors, must create their own branch and open a pull request.
- Contributors should not share branches unless the code owner explicitly coordinates that work.
- Pull requests must pass build validation before merge.
- Pull requests must include a contributor log update under `contributors/<contributor-name>/README.md`.
- Direct pushes to `main` should be blocked in GitHub branch protection settings.
- This repo also includes a local `.githooks/pre-push` guard. Enable it after cloning with `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`.

## Recommended GitHub Branch Protection

For repository admins, configure `main` with:

- Require a pull request before merging.
- Require approvals before merging.
- Dismiss stale approvals when new commits are pushed.
- Require conversation resolution before merging.
- Require status checks before merging.
- Require branch to be up to date before merging.
- Restrict who can push to matching branches to Mudasar Ahmad only.
- Do not allow force pushes.
- Do not allow deletions.
- Include administrators if the team wants the rule to apply even to admins.

Recommended required status check:

```text
npm run build
```

Local hook setup:

```powershell
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

## Branch Naming

Use short, descriptive branches that identify the owner or workstream:

```text
mudasar/admin-integrations-status
feature/<contributor-name>/admin-integrations-status
fix/<contributor-name>/pmo-queue-layout
docs/<contributor-name>/agent-guardrails
```

Avoid vague branch names such as `changes`, `fixes`, `new-work`, or `agent-output`.

## Avoiding Merge Conflicts

- Pull the latest `main` before creating a branch.
- Keep each branch focused on one feature, screen, or fix.
- Do not let multiple agents edit the same file unless one agent owns the file and the others provide notes only.
- Coordinate ownership of high-conflict files such as `src/styles.scss`, `src/app/core/models.ts`, and shared services.
- Prefer small PRs over broad multi-screen rewrites.
- Avoid formatting entire files unless formatting is the explicit task.
- Update docs in the same PR as the behavior change.

## Resolving Merge Conflicts

1. Commit or stash your current work.
2. Fetch the latest remote changes.
3. Rebase or merge the latest `main` into your branch.
4. Resolve conflicts by preserving the intended behavior from both sides.
5. Re-run `npm run build`.
6. Review the diff before pushing.
7. Push the resolved branch and update the PR description with conflict-resolution notes.

Recommended commands:

```powershell
git fetch origin
git switch <your-branch>
git rebase origin/main
```

If the rebase becomes confusing:

```powershell
git rebase --abort
```

Then ask the code owner or coordinating contributor for help.

## AI Agent Rules

- Each AI agent must be assigned an explicit file/folder scope.
- AI agents must read `AGENTS.md`, `SECURITY_GUIDELINES.md`, and this file before editing.
- AI agents must not overwrite unrelated user or agent work.
- AI agents must report files changed, tests run, and unresolved risks.
- Contributors are responsible for reviewing AI-generated code before opening a PR.
